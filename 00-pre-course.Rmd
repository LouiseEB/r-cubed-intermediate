# Pre-course tasks {#pre-course}

Complete everything in this pre-course tasks section and complete the survey
at the end.

## Installing the latest programs

Given this is an intermediate course, you should already have R and RStudio
installed. However, you may not have the latest versions installed.

1. Have the latest version of [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/index.html)
installed (preferably >4.0.0, but it is fine if you have at least 3.6.0).
1. Have the latest version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
installed (preferably the latest 1.3 version, but at least 1.2.5001 is fine).

There are a few other things to install:

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). We'll be using Git 
(building off of the Introduction course), so it needs to be installed.
1. For some Windows users, you may need to install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/Rtools35.exe)
in order for some R packages to be installed (which you'll do shortly).

All these programs are required for the course, even Git.
Git, which is a software program to formally manage file versions, 
is used because of it's popularity and the amount of documentation available for it.
Check out the online book [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/),
especially the "Why Git" section, to understand why we are teaching Git.
Windows users tend to have more trouble with installing Git than macOS or Linux users.
See the section on [Installing Git for Windows](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#install-git-windows) for help.

If you have administrative issues with updating R or RStudio to the latest version,
and you have at least 3.6.0 for R and at least 1.2.5001 for RStudio, 
it should be fine. Unfortunately, work computers may not have Git installed and
it *is required* for the course, so please ask your IT for help if you need
administrative permissions to installing it.

Once R, RStudio, and Git have been installed, open RStudio. 
*If at any point during these pre-course tasks you have any troubles*, 
try as best as you can to complete the task and then let me know about the
issues in the pre-course survey (at the end of this section). 
If you continue having problems, indicate on the survey that you need help
and we can try to book a quick video call to fix the problem. 
Otherwise, if you can, come to the course earlier (15-20 min) to get help.

## Installing the R packages

We will be using specific R packages for the course, 
so you will need to install them.
A detailed walkthrough for installing the necessary packages is
available on the [pre-course tasks for installing packages](https://r-cubed-v2.rostools.org/pre-course.html#installing-r-packages)
section of the beginner course,
however, you only need to install the r3 helper package in order to install
all the necessary packages:

1. Install the remotes package: `install.packages("remotes")`.
2. Install the helper package for this course, r3: `remotes::install_gitlab("rostools/r3", upgrade = TRUE)`

*Note*: When you see a command like `something::something()`,
for example with `remotes::install_gitlab()`, you would "read" this as:

> R, can you please use the install_gitlab function from the remotes package.

The normal way of doing this would be to load the package with `library(remotes)` 
and then running the command (`install_gitlab()`).
But by using the `::`, we tell R to directly use a function from a package,
without needing to load the package. We use this trick because we only want to
use the `install_gitlab()` command from the remotes package and not have to load
all the other functions from remotes.

## Setting up Git

Since Git has already been covered in the Introduction course, 
we won't cover it during this course.
If you have used or currently use Git, you can skip this section.
If you haven't used it, please do these tasks:

1. Follow the [pre-course tasks for Git and GitHub](https://r-cubed-v2.rostools.org/pre-course.html#setting-up-git-and-github)
from the beginner's course.

2. Read through the 
[Version Control lesson](https://r-cubed-v2.rostools.org/version-control.html)
of the beginner course.
*You don't need to do any of the exercises or activities*.

## Create an R project for the course

One of the basic steps to reproducibility and modern workflows in data analysis
is to keep everything contained in a single location.
In RStudio, this is done with projects.
Please read all of [Section 6.1](https://r-cubed-v2.rostools.org/r-project-management.html#what-is-a-project-and-why-use-it)
to learn about R Projects and keeping things self-contained. 
*You don't need to do any of the exercises or activities*.

There are several ways to organise a project folder.
Weâ€™ll be using the structure from the package prodigenr. 
The project setup can be done by either:

1. Use RStudio's New Project menu item: "File -> New Project -> New Directory",
scroll down to "Scientific Analysis Project using prodigenr" and name the project
"LearnR3" in the Directory Name, saving it to the "Desktop" with Browse.
2. Run the command `prodigenr::setup_project("~/Desktop/LearnR3")` in the Console.

When the RStudio Project opens up again, run these two commands in the Console:

```r
usethis::use_blank_slate()
usethis::use_r("functions", open = FALSE)
```

## R Markdown

We teach and use R Markdown because it is one of the very first steps to being
reproducible and because it is a very powerful tool to doing data analysis.
If you use R Markdown already, you can skip this step. Otherwise,
please read over [the R Markdown section](https://r-cubed-v2.rostools.org/reproducible-documents.html)
of the beginner course.

## Course introduction

Most of the description of the course is found in the [syllabus](syllabus.html).
If you haven't read it, **please read it now**.
Read over what the course will cover, 
what we expect you to learn at the end of it,
and what our basic assumptions are about who you are and what you know.
The final pre-course task is a survey that asks some questions on if you've read
and understood it.

One goal of the course is to teach about open science,
and true to our mission, we practice what we preach.
The course material is publicly accessible (all on this website) and 
[openly licensed](index.html#licensing) so you can use and re-use it for free!
The material is ordered as we will cover it during the course.
The course includes lots of hands-on exercises that you can work on.

We have a [Code of Conduct](conduct.html).
If you haven't read it, **read it now**. 
The survey at the end will ask about Conduct.
We want to make sure this course is a supportive 
and safe environment for learning,
so this Code of Conduct is important.

You're almost done.
Please fill out the [pre-course survey] to finish this assignment.

See you at the course!
