Some material was taken and modified from multiple sources (most
of which I've created, been involved in, or contributed to), including:

- [UofTCoders Reproducible Quantitative Methods for EEB](https://uoftcoders.github.io/rcourse/) 
- [Software and Data Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/) workshop material
- [UofTCoders material](https://uoftcoders.github.io/studyGroup/lessons/)
and [AU CRU material](https://au-cru.github.io/site/material/),
from the peer led and contributed lessons
- From version 1 of the [*"Reproducible Quantitative Methods: Data analysis workflow using R"*](https://v1--dda-rcourse.netlify.com/) course

The course material gets inspiration from these resources:

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
