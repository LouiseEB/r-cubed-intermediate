## Learning objectives

1. Using the concept of "pivoting" to arrange data from long to wide and vice versa.
1. 

## Setup for the analysis in R Markdown

We now have a working dataset to start doing some simple analyses on in the
R Markdown document. A recommended workflow with R Markdown is to often
"Knit" it and make sure your analysis is reproducible (while on your computer).
So let's first clean it up and start from the beginning again.

Before we do that, make sure to add and commit all changes done in `doc/lesson.Rmd`.
By keeping changes in the history, we can go back to look at it anytime.

Then, we'll delete everything from below the `setup` code chunk until the end of the file.
This code chunk should have all the packages listed with `library()` functions.
We'll also add `load()` one right below them so we have access to the newly 
merged dataset:

```r
source(here("R/functions.R"))
load(here("data/mmash.rda"))
```

When everything has been deleted, add and commit these changes into the Git history.
Then, we'll "Knit" our R Markdown document into HTML by using the "Knit" button
at the top of the pane or with `Ctrl-Shift-K`. Once it creates the file, it should
either pop up or open in the Viewer pane on the side. 

As we write more R code and do some simple analyses of the data, we are going
to be knitting often. The main reason for this is to ensure that whatever we
are writing and coding will at least be reproducible on our computer, since
R Markdown is designed to ensure the document is reproducible.

For this specific workflow and for checking reproducibility, you should output
to HTML rather than to a Word document. While you can create a Word document by
changing the `output: html_document` to `output: word_document` at the top in
the YAML header, you'd only do this when you need to submit to a journal or
need to email to co-authors for review. The reason is simple: After you generate
the Word document from R Markdown, the Word file opens up and consequently Word
locks the file from further edits. What that means is that every time you generate
the Word document, you have to close it before you can generate it again,
otherwise knitting will fail. This can get annoying very quickly (trust me),
since you don't always remember to close the Word document. If you output to
HTML, this won't be a problem.

## Re-arranging data for easier summarizing

`r details_for_instructors("
Walk through and explain this section, making use of the tables and graphs.
")`

Now that we have the final dataset to work with, we want to explore it a bit
with some simple descriptive statistics. One powerful 
Pivoting is an extremely useful action when working with data. Pivoting is when
you convert data between longer forms (more rows) and wider forms (more columns).
The [tidyr] package within tidyverse contains two wonderful functions for pivoting:
`pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`. There is a well written documentation
on pivoting in the [tidy website][tidyr-pivoting] that can explain more about it.
The first thing we'll use, and probably the more commonly used in general,
is `pivot_longer()`. This function is commonly used because entering data in
the wide form is easier and more time efficient than entering data in long form.
For instance, if you were measuring glucose values over time in participants,
you might enter data in like this:

[tidyr]: https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/index.html
[tidyr-pivoting]: https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html

```{r table-example-wide, echo=FALSE}
example_wide <- tribble(
    ~person_id, ~glucose_0, ~glucose_30, ~glucose_60,
    1, 5.6, 7.8, 4.5,
    2, 4.7, 9.5, 5.3,
    3, 5.1, 10.2, 4.2
) 

example_wide %>% 
    knitr::kable(caption = "Example of a **wide** dataset that is useful for data entry.",
                 align = "c")
```

However, when it comes time to analyze the data, this wide form is very inefficient
and difficult to computationally and statistically work with. So, we do data
entry in wide and use functions like `pivot_longer()` to get the data ready for
analysis. Figure \@ref(fig:image-pivot-longer) visually shows what happens when
you pivot from wide to long.

```{r image-pivot-longer, fig.cap="Pivot longer in tidyr. New columns are called 'name' and 'value'.", out.width="70%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/pivot-longer.png"))
```

If you had, for instance, an ID column for each participant, the pivoting would 
look like what is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:image-pivot-longer-id).

```{r image-pivot-longer-id, fig.cap="Pivot longer in tidyr, excluding an 'id' column. New columns are called 'name' and 'value', as well as the old 'id' column.", out.width="70%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/pivot-longer-id.png"))
```

Pivoting is a conceptually challenging thing to grasp, so don't be disheartened
if you can't understand how it works yet. As you practice using it, you will
understand it. With `pivot_longer()`, the first argument is the data.
The other arguments are:

1. `cols`: The columns to use to convert to long form. The input is a vector
made using `c()` that contains the column names, like you would use in
`select()` (e.g. you can use the `select_helpers` like `starts_with()`, or `-`
minus to exclude).
1. `names_to`: Optional, default is `name`. If provided, it will be the name of
the newly created column (as a quoted character) that contains the original
column names.
1. `values_to`: Optional, default is `value`. Like `names_to`, sets the name of 
the new columns.

Let's try this out with `mmash`. In your `doc/lesson.Rmd` file, create a new
header called `## Pivot longer` and create a new code chunk below that. Now we can
start typing in our code:

```{r pivot-everything-error, error=TRUE}
mmash %>% 
    # pivot every column
    pivot_longer(everything())
```

Ok, this gives an error because we are mixing data types. Let's pivot only 
numbers.

```{r pivot-numeric}
mmash %>% 
    pivot_longer(where(is.numeric))
```

Nice! But not super useful. We can exclude specific columns from pivoting
with `-` before the column name, for instance with `user_id` and `day`. Let's
drop the `samples` column before pivoting:

```{r pivot-longer-example}
mmash %>% 
    select(-samples) %>% 
    pivot_longer(c(-user_id, -day, -gender))
```

## Exercise: Pivot your summarised results to longer form

Time: 10 min

Use `pivot_longer()` after the `group_by()` and `summarise()` we did previously:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mmash %>% 
    group_by(day) %>% 
    summarise(across(
        c(age, weight),
        list(mean = mean, sd = sd), 
        na.rm = TRUE
    ))
```

1. Look into the help documentation of `ends_with()` and use it for pivoting only
the columns that end with `mean` and `sd`.
    - Hint: `ends_with()` is *vectorized* meaning you can give it a vector of
    column endings.
1. After using the `pivot_longer()`, knit the R Markdown document into HTML 
(`Ctrl-Shift-K` or the "Knit" button).
1. Open up the Git interface and add and commit the changes to `doc/lesson.Rmd`.

```{r solution-pivot-summary, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
mmash %>% 
    group_by(day) %>% 
    summarise(across(
        c(age, weight),
        list(mean = mean, sd = sd), 
        na.rm = TRUE
    )) %>% 
    pivot_longer(ends_with(c("mean", "sd")))
```

## Pivot data to wider form

After using `pivot_longer()` on the summarized data, it looks nice, but it still 
has a problem: We have both mean and standard deviation values in the same column.
It would be nicer if we had two columns, one for means and one for the sd values.
We couldn't pivot to wider right now because that would put it right back from
where we got it. So instead, we need to separate the existing `name` column
into two columns for `name` and `summary_statistic`. We can do this when
we use `pivot_longer()` by using the `names_to` and `names_sep` arguments:

- `names_to` can take a vector of new column names that will be created,
meaning if you give it two new names, it will create two columns. But, when it
has more than one new column name, it relies on you also using at least `names_sep`.
- `names_sep`, which means "names separation", is used to tell `pivot_longer()`
that a specific character separates two or more distinct possible columns. In
our case, `_` separates the variable name from `mean` or `sd`.

So, add these two arguments:

```{r pivot-longer-separate}
mmash %>% 
    group_by(day) %>% 
    summarise(across(
        c(age, weight),
        list(mean = mean, sd = sd), 
        na.rm = TRUE
    )) %>% 
    pivot_longer(ends_with(c("_mean", "_sd")),
                 names_sep = "_",
                 names_to = c("name", "summary_statistic"))
```

Now we are in a good position to pivot wider. So how does `pivot_wider()` work?
Like its opposite `pivot_longer()`, the first position argument is the data and
the other arguments are:

1. `id_cols`: This is optional as it will default to all column names. 
This argument tells `pivot_wider()` to use the given columns as the identifiers
for when converting. Unlike `pivot_longer()` which doesn't require some type of
"key" or "id" column to convert to long form, the conversion to wide form
works requires some type of "key" or "id" column because `pivot_wider()` needs
to know which rows belong with each other.
1. `names_from`: Similar to the `pivot_longer()`, 
this is the name of the column that has the values that will make up the new
columns. Unlike with the `names_to` argument in `pivot_longer()` which takes a
character string as input, the column name for `names_from` must be *unquoted*
because you are selecting a column that already exists in the dataset.
1. `values_from`: Same as `names_from`, this is the column name (that exists and
must be given *unquoted*) for the values that will be in the new columns.

Figure \@ref(fig:image-pivot-wider) visually shows what's happening when using
`pivot_wider()`.

```{r image-pivot-wider, fig.cap="Pivot wider in tidyr.", out.width="70%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/pivot-wider.png"))
```

In our case, we want the new column names to come from `summary_statistic`
and the values to come from `value`. Let's add it to the end of our pipe:

```{r pivot-wider-summary-end}
mmash %>% 
    group_by(day) %>% 
    summarise(across(
        c(age, weight),
        list(mean = mean, sd = sd), 
        na.rm = TRUE
    )) %>% 
    pivot_longer(ends_with(c("_mean", "_sd")),
                 names_sep = "_",
                 names_to = c("name", "summary_statistic")) %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = summary_statistic, 
                values_from = value) 
```

And technically, you can pivot longer and wider all at once by using some features of
`pivot_longer()`. The only change we need to make to the `pivot_longer()` code
is replace `"summary_statistic"` with the special setting `".value"`. Delete the
`pivot_wider()` function and you have a longer-to-wider dataset! We didn't cover
this first because we wanted to show how to use `pivot_wider()` on its own.

```{r}
mmash %>% 
    group_by(day) %>% 
    summarise(across(
        c(age, weight),
        list(mean = mean, sd = sd), 
        na.rm = TRUE
    )) %>% 
    pivot_longer(ends_with(c("_mean", "_sd")),
                 names_sep = "_",
                 names_to = c("name", ".value"))
```

## Exercise: Convert this code into a function

Time: 15 min

Using the same workflow we've been doing throughout this course,
convert this code into a function.

1. Name the function `tidy_summarise_by_day`.
1. Create two arguments, called `data` and `columns`.
    - To work well with the pipe, put the `data` argument first.
1. Test it to see it work by using `age` in the `columns` argument.
    - It won't work and will throw an error. In the next section we will cover
    how to debug the function.
1. Move it over into `R/functions.R`, add Roxygen documentation, and use
explicit function calls with `packagename::`.
    - Don't forget, use `?functionname` to find out which package the function
    comes from.

```{r solution-summarise-function, echo=FALSE}
tidy_summarise_by_day <- function(data, columns) {
    data %>%
        dplyr::group_by(day) %>%
        dplyr::summarise(dplyr::across(columns,
                                       list(mean = mean, sd = sd),
                                       na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
        tidyr::pivot_longer(dplyr::ends_with(c("_mean", "_sd")),
                            names_to = c("name", ".value"),
                            names_sep = "_") 
}
```

## Debugging functions

Debugging is one of those things that seems really scary and difficult, but
once you try it and use it, is actually not as intimidating. To debug, which means
to find and fix problems in your code, there are several ways, the simplest of
which is by adding the `browser()` function to the start of your function and
then re-running the function (either by manually running it or with `Ctrl-Shift-S` to
`source()` the file).

```{r}
test_debugging <- function(number) {
    number + number
}
```


TODO: Update this section
The skills from this are directly usable
when using `browser()`. In the `R/functions.R` file, go to the
... function and click the space to the left of the line
number for the first line *inside* the function. There will be something that
pops up at the top of the pane saying something like:

> "Breakpoints will be activated when the package is built and reloaded."

<!-- TODO: eventually add an image or video.. but for next year. -->

Activate it by running `source()` with `Ctrl-Shift-S` while in the functions
file. The dot should now be solid red, rather than a circle. In the Console,
type out and run the code:

```{r, error=TRUE}
#...
```

You may have also already written that code previously, so you can use the up
arrow in the Console to go back to it. After running the code, a bunch of things
happen: 

- A yellow line will highlight the code in the function, along with a green arrow
on the left of the line number
- The Console will now start with `Browse[1]>` will have text like `debug at ...`
- There will be new buttons on the top of the Console like "Next", "Continue",
and "Stop"
- The Environment pane will be empty and will say "Traceback"

<!-- TODO: Add image or video of this or extend it from previous video? -->
<!-- TODO: Image of debugging changes, with descriptions -->

We are now in debug mode. In this mode you can really investigate what is happening
with your code and how to fix it. The way to figure out what's wrong is by running
the code bit by bit. First let's check that the first works by highlighting
the code (shown below) and running it.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data
```

After highlighting and running this, we see that it works fine. Alright, next step:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data %>%
    dplyr::group_by(day)
```

Still is fine. Next:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data %>%
    dplyr::group_by(day) %>%
    dplyr::summarise(dplyr::across(columns,
                                   list(mean = mean, sd = sd),
                                   na.rm = TRUE))
```

Ah, here is where the problem occurs. The argument `columns` contains the
`age` variable we want to use in `summarise()`... but the problem is that
R is interpreting `age` as an object that exists in the R session when in reality
it only exists in the `mmash` data frame. But it works when we use it outside of 
the function, why not here?

So what's happening? We've encountered a problem due to "[non-standard
evaluation][nse]" (or NSE). NSE is a feature of R and is used quite a lot throughout
R, but is especially used in the tidyverse packages. It's one of the first
things computer scientists complain about when they use R, because it is such a
foreign thing in other programming languages. But NSE is what allows you to use
formulas (e.g. `y ~ x + x2` in modeling) or allows you to type out
`select(Gender, BMI)` or `library(purrr)`. In "standard evaluation", it
would instead be `select("Gender", "BMI")` or `library("purrr")`. So NSE gives
flexibility and ease of use for the user (we don't have to type quotes every
time) when doing data analysis, but can give some headaches when programming in
R, like with making functions. There's more detail about this on the 
[dplyr website][dplyr-programming], which will give a few options, the simplest 
of which is to wrap `columns` inside the `across()` function with `{{}}`. So,
let's "Stop" the debugging, add these curly brackets to `columns`, and remove 
the Breakpoint by clicking it (if it hasn't been removed already).

[nse]: https://adv-r.had.co.nz/Computing-on-the-language.html
[dplyr-programming]: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html#warm-up

```{r}
tidy_summarise_by_day <- function(data, columns) {
    data %>%
        dplyr::group_by(day) %>%
        dplyr::summarise(dplyr::across({{columns}},
                                       list(mean = mean, sd = sd),
                                       na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
        tidyr::pivot_longer(dplyr::ends_with(c("_mean", "_sd")),
                            names_to = c("name", ".value"),
                            names_sep = "_") 
}
```

Now, if we run the function again:

```{r}
load(here("data/mmash.rda"))
tidy_summarise_by_day(mmash, age)
```

Yea! It works! If we want to include other variables:

```{r}
tidy_summarise_by_day(mmash, c(age, weight))
```

## Exercise: Extend the function to allow adding other summary statistics

Time: 20 min

We've made the function so that we can include any column we want, but now
let's make it so we can include any summary function we want, not just `mean()`
and `sd()`, as a new argument called `summary_fn`. This task will be
*challenging*, so discuss and work with your neighbour on completing this
exercise. Work within the debugging environment to deal with this problem.

- *Hints*: 
    - `list(mean = mean, ...)` is a named list, meaning you can use `names()`
    to get a vector of the names of the list. 
    - You will have to create an intermediate object based on the new `summary_fn`
    argument. 

```{r solution-summary-extend, echo=FALSE}
tidy_summarise_by_day <- function(data, columns, summary_fn) {
    fn_names <- names(summary_fn)
    data %>%
        dplyr::group_by(day) %>%
        dplyr::summarise(dplyr::across({{columns}},
                                       summary_fn,
                                       na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
        tidyr::pivot_longer(dplyr::ends_with(fn_names),
                            names_to = c("name", ".value"),
                            names_sep = "_") 
}
```

## Making prettier output in R Markdown

What we created is nice and all, but since we are working in an R Markdown
document and knitting to HTML, let's make it easier for others (including
yourself) to read the document. Let's make the output as actual tables.
We can do that with `knitr::kable()` (meaning "knitr table"). We can even
add a table caption with the `caption` argument.

```{r}
mmash %>% 
    tidy_summarise_by_day(c(age, weight, height),
                          list(mean = mean, min = min, max = max)) %>% 
    knitr::kable(caption = "Descriptive statistics of some variables.")
```

Then knit the document and check out the HTML file. So pretty! `r emo::ji("grin")`

## General workflow up to this point {#general-workflow}

You now have some skills and tools to allow you to reproducibly import,
process, clean, join, and eventually analyze your datasets.
For the next two exercises, you will apply these skills and tools. 
Listed below are the general workflows we've covered and that you
can use as a guideline to completing the following exercises:

- Import with the `vroom()`, `spec()`, `vroom()` workflow.
- Convert into a function with the `doc/lesson.Rmd` to `R/function.R`,
restart R, and `source()` workflow.
- Test that the datasets join properly while in `doc/lesson.Rmd`
then cut and paste into `data-raw/mmash.R` workflow.
- Restart R and re-create the `data/mmash.rda` dataset by
sourcing `data-raw/mmash.R` workflow.
- Restart R, load the new dataset with `load()`, 
and analyze it in `doc/lesson.Rmd` workflow.
- Add any additional cleaning code to `data-raw/mmash.R` and
update the `data/mmash.rda` dataset whenever you find problems
workflow.
- Write R in code chunks in the `doc/lesson.Rmd` to further
analyze your data and check reproducibility by often knitting to
HTML workflow.
    - Part of this workflow is to also write R code to output
    in a way that looks nice in the HTML (or Word) output
    by mostly e.g. creating tables or figures of the output.

And **don't forget**, for each stage, add and commit the changes
you've made to the files into the Git history.

## Exercise: Process and join sleep and questionnaire data

Time: 25 min

There are still a few datasets that you can join in with the current
datasets like `sleep.csv` and `questionnaire.csv`. 
Using the workflows in Section \@ref(general-workflow) as a guide,
start from the beginning and import, process, clean, make functions,
and join these two datasets in with the others so that they get 
included in the `data/mmash.rda` final dataset. Afterwards, do some
descriptive analysis using the function ...
TODO: function name?

## Exercise: Create a second dataset of only the Actigraph and RR data

Time: 25 min

The Actigraph and RR datasets contain a ton of interesting and useful
data that gets destroyed when we first summarize and then join them
with the other datasets. While we can't meaningfully join all this
data with the other datasets, we can join them on their own.

Using the workflows in Section \@ref(general-workflow) as a guide,
start from the beginning and import, process, clean, make functions,
and create a final dataset of only the `Actigraph.csv` and `RR.csv`
datasets.

- Join only these two datasets by `user_id`, `day`, and `time`.
- Name the new dataset `actigraph_rr` and save it to `data/`
by using another `usethis::use_data()` line in the `data-raw/mmash.R`
script.

## Misc

Let's do some descriptive statistics. Let's find out the mean and standard 
deviations of some variables by day. We will use `group_by()` and `summarise(across())`
like previously. First, in `doc/lesson.Rmd` create a new header called `##
Split-apply-combine` and make a new code chunk below it.

```{r}
mmash %>% 
    group_by(day) %>% 
    summarise(across(
        c(age, weight),
        list(mean = mean, sd = sd), 
        na.rm = TRUE
    ))
```

We can see from this that there is a random day of `-29` with `NaN` for age and
weight, as well as a missing day where mean age is 28 and mean weight is 70.
We can always fix this at a later point, but for now, we will ignore them.
Let's look at some other summary statistics, like `min()` and `max()`.
We add these into the `list()` with the other statistics:

```{r}
mmash %>% 
    group_by(day) %>% 
    summarise(across(
        c(age, weight),
        list(mean = mean, sd = sd, 
             min = min, max = max), 
        na.rm = TRUE
    ))
```

We could keep adding other variables and other summary statistics, but 
you can see the dataset is quickly become harder and harder to read.
