You can go over this point verbally, reiterating what they've learned so
far.

You now have some skills and tools to allow you to reproducibly import,
process, clean, join, and eventually analyze your datasets. Listed below
are the general workflows we've covered and that you can use as a
guideline to complete the following (optional) exercises and group work.

-   Import with the `vroom()`, and optionally use `spec()` to `vroom()`
    again to select specific variables.
-   Convert importing into a function in a Quarto / R Markdown document,
    move to the `R/function.R` script, restarting R, and `source()`.
-   Test that joining datasets into a final form works properly while in
    a Quarto / R Markdown document, then cut and paste the code into a
    data processing R script in the `data-raw/` folder (alternatively,
    you can directly write and test code while in the `data-raw/` R
    script).
-   Restart R and generate the `.rda` dataset in the `data/` folder by
    sourcing the `data-raw/` R script.
-   Restart R, load the new dataset with `load()` and put the loading
    code into a Quarto / R Markdown document.
-   Add any additional cleaning code to the data processing R script in
    `data-raw/` and update the `.rda` dataset in `data/` whenever you
    encounter problems in the dataset.
-   Write R in code chunks in a Quarto / R Markdown document to further
    analyze your data and check reproducibility by often rendering to
    HTML.
    -   Part of this workflow is to also write R code to output in a way
        that looks nice in the HTML (or Word) formats by mostly creating
        tables or figures of the R output.
-   Use Git often by adding and committing into the history so you never
    lose stuff and can keep track of changes to your files.
