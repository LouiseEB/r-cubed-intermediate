# Iteration with functional programming {#functionals-map}


<!-- Day 2 afternoon (13:15, end at 16:45 --- ~3.5 hrs, with one big break, one small one during exercise): -->

- functional programming
    - Expand on explanation
    - purrr
    - Why purrr vs *apply functions?
        - Consistency, expectation, documentation, design.
    - Show importing one vs many
        - Use fs to list multiple files
        - Talk about filesystem
    - Possible uses:
        - Show basic usage with paste and numbers, etc.
        - calculating mean from df
            - select only numeric (select where is.numeric)
            - show off the ... here (like with na.rm)
        - Any time you think you would use a for loop, use this.
        - Import data, with some wrangling, for https://physionet.org/content/mmash/1.0.0/
            - Using what we learned to wrangle all data files into one single one
        - Run multiple models and extract only some information
        - Run models on re-sampled sets
        - Combining with parallel processing?
            - Don't get them to do this, just show it.
    - Real examples: 
        - my webscraping of the DST etc
        - Running multiple models
    - Show but don't get them to do: other versions of functions in purrr
    
- slides afterward
    - Incorporate open and reproducible practices in coding

Post course?
