day,session,worked_well,could_be_improved
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","Easy to follow, works very well with all the code in the online material.","For me it was a bit too slow in the way that importing data is more ""boring"" than writing functions, which we did not get to until around 13.30-14. Maybe copy-paste code from online material instead of writing everything?"
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","It was a super great introduction, it really made a deep and good understanding, and the code along was excellent",The room made it difficult to listen to the lectures while people got help.
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",The coding along makes much more easier to understand the teaching received,"I think it would be nice to reduce the dependency on external (or extra) packages, trying to increase the utilities included in R already (utils, base, stats packages)"
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Coding along while everyting is demonstrated on screen is helpful to understand how things work.,"In general, not just for ""Basic setup and workflow"" it might be helpful if the keyboard shortcuts for macbooks could be mentioned as they seem to be different - but that's a minor thing, one can of course find out by going to the correct buttons to look it up or just by trying it out"
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",The pace was really good and easy to follow. I did not feel like I got lost a single time,Maybe some optional exercises if you finish early? I had some time to spare and got a little bored
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Everything worked well :),It was good
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",The setup and the workflow was pretty clear,Nothing that I can think of right now.
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",We went nice and slowly most of the time.,Nothing
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",a lot of hands-on,I'm sometimes missing the point of certain steps and just copy the code and see that it worksâ€¦ so maybe some explanation?
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Coding along sessions worked very well with the help of instructors,It was OK
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Mix between introduction and exercises,N/A
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",It has been great,it has been great
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Nice with the code-along. Easy to get help when needed.,"The room is not great (it easily gets a bit loud when instructors help while one is presenting) - this has nothing to do with the course itself, but more the surroundings."
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Having the detailed code along and exercises to then test what we just learned.,"Nothing, I think it worked ver nicely."
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",The code-alongs are a good format,I think I need a bit more information on why each of the steps are important/useful
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Post-its for help worked well,"Some technical problems, but other than that all good"
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",It worked well that every code was written on the big screen so that it was possible to follow along,"It would be nice with a small introduction before each new subject so we get the bigger picture / purpose of the coding. Moreover, it would be nice with a general explanation of git. I have difficulties in understanding the concept even after reading material from intro-course."
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Nice step-by-step walk-through,"I can't think right now, my brain is fried"
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",It is great that several instructors are ready to give feedback and help doing the course.,"A general comment is, that I think we could learn more from the course if there were more time to practice the tasks. A thought could be to do more half days so that we have the chance to look at the programme between the sessions."
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","Introduced the vroom package to me. Also found the fs and here package to be useful. Also, in general, the code-along with the stickers seems like a very good way to ensure people are following along.","I very much crave to know what actually happens when one runs a function, which I did not get to know from the lecture itself. As an example, I would have loved to know that what vroom actually does it that it builds upon reader, where it can automatically detect the file type and structure. Also, for example that fs is just basically a package that enables streamlined terminal commands independent of the terminal environment. I fell like this could very easily be fixed, by just briefly talking what the package does and why it is useful when first introducing them."
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself",Easy to follow.,"It might be difficult to apply to own data because of little explanation of different packages and functions. But then again, very small thing considering that it is probably easier to understand these things when reading it for yourself."
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself",It was SO great to learn to do the functions!,It was a bit hardcore for the afternoon session.
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself","Hands-on with real data, simple code, fast, clear.","Again, maybe try to use basics R functions instead of package-derived, for reproducibility"
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself",It was nice to learn about the function and map functions. Exercises are good to practise the theory.,Maybe more exercises with less explicit help in the text would be useful as a next step to further practise using the code just learned
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself",It highlighted the interplay between the markdown and the scripts really well and showed how useful it can be,"Exercises got a little repetetive, I did not feel it was necessary to do it for all four data sets."
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself",Everything worked well :),More reading materials for pre-course tasks
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself",The examples and explanations were clear and the corresponding exercises were helpful.,Nothing that I can think of right now.
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself",We got exposure to many packages/functions etc. so it was great to see what is possible in R Studio,"The second half went really fast and I got a little bit lost, plus it felt like a big jump between the content taught and our final exercise but maybe that just reflects a decent challenge/learning"
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself",same as above,same as above. Especially the end of the session was difficult and the late hour made me quite unfocused
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself",Writing functions was very motivating  and I really liked to see that I can write my own functions for a particular analysis.,The most intense part was at the end of the day so we were a bit tired. It would be better if there would be a way to do these exercises with fresher minds .
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself",Mix between introduction and exercises,N/A
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself",everything and especially the excercises,In general this has been great. One thing that could be improved: I would have liked the functions was related to not importing data but rather data cleaning problems.
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself","Great that we can find all the code online. Makes it faster and easier to code-along, and check you own coding.","It's a bit tricky getting an overview of the main functions of the different packages, when you have never heard about them before - but don't think this necessarily can be changed."
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself","Learning how to make functions then functionals, as well as map","Nothing, I think it works well"
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself",The exercises were good to practice the skills independently,"I am still finding it difficult to understand how all of this information fits together (e.g., packages, functions, arguments), so I could use a bit more of an overview or more context-setting before we jump into the code-alongs"
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself",Worked well. Good skills to have for the future.,Nothing to report.
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself",The same as above,The same as above
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself",Nice step-by-step walk-through,The last exercise was tough with a fried brain! Maybe better to give a little more help OR wait for next morning to recap with a fresh brain
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself",It is great that several instructors are ready to give feedback and help doing the course.,"It was a bit harder to follow this part of the course compared to the first part. Further, I think it is a bit too long time to try focus and work within the programme - it affected the concentration in the end."
Day 1,"Save time, don't repeat yourself","I did not know about the roxygen skeleton thing, so it was nice to get that introduced.","I have quite a lot of functions, so while there weren't anything I did not understand I do have a suggestion for improvement which I believe could improve the comprehension of what a function actually is and how it works. It was briefly touched upon with the add_numbers function, but I think it would have been great, to take a function like mean, and recreate using different methods.For example, first showing the easy way by using sum/ count. But then also show it done by creating a loop where you manually count and keep the sum in a buffer - not because one should do it like this, but rather to demystify what a function actually does."
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,I think that there were lots of nice exercises that meant we could go away and learn how to troubleshoot the problems we faced.,There was quite a bit of content to be covered.
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,the content of the session was good,the instructor needed to explain more what we were doing and when
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,Think it all worked fine. Think its really good when the lecture adds titles to the codes - makes it easier for us to keep track on what we are doing.,Could maybe make use of titles ## a bit more if possible.
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,"We got appropriate time to do the exercises, which where very meaningful.",It could be great to do some of the tasks on datasets that we will use in real-life later on - but I know that it might not be possible within the short time.
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,Course material was extremely good,"The exercises took a bit too long, I ended up waiting around quite a bit"
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,teachers assistance and discussion on options,maybe small groups working to speed up things
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,Very useful... the whole code-along and the material was super great,"Perhaps there was a little too much time for the exercises, but that is also sometimes quite nice... and I know some people struggled"
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,Everything :),More reading materials and hands on before the course
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,I like how you learn to go back and clean up your markdown file.,"No comments, really good!"
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,Good combination of coding along and exercise and repeating,N/A
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,Everything,Nothing
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,Good skills to have!,"In general (all sessions), some more clear breaks would help."
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,making functions that do it nicely,"sometimes going too fast and i was missing the point of doing some of the steps, as you try and hurry to keep up and get it right"
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,I can't think,More explanations along the way
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,everything,nothing
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,"Easy to follow, good help. Introduction of new stuff.","I think there was too much time for exercises or maybe just a need for additional exercises, for the people who do not have too many problems"
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,The concepts were clearly explained with examples,More exercises might be interesting
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,It was really nice to experience that we 'wrapped the work up' - it somehow gave an overview of what we had been doing.,"Maybe I felt like I needed information on how to use everything as documentation for others - like if we should link or refer to our statistics in a paper, how would we do that? Would it be with a R markdown file?"
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,"Very simple and concise way of teaching the concept, especially regular expressions. I never knew that you could export data as a ready R-data file, so it was great to know that that is possible.",A lot of the code-along section did not specify arguments. I would prefer to get them defined the first time when using them.
Day 2,Processing datasets for cleaning,"Combining different data frames together, wrangling data into a final form and generating a framework to do that was very beneficial for me.","I think this session was intense. I feel that, after this session we all become tired and could not focus well to the next session."
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,Luke was a really engaging speaker to finish off the day.,Nil
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,the content of the session,the cut and past from the lesson (markdown) document was a bit tricky since we had so much other code in there
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,All worked fine.,"It's a bit hard to concentrate at the end of this part - maybe having a bit shorter days, and have an extra day (day 3) would help?"
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,Luke is good to explain the coding which give a higher understanding of the fundermental understanding of the elements behind coding.,"A general thought in line with previous comments is that an idea could be to spread the course over a longer period of time, so that we had the chance to work on the different sections between the course days. That would have meant that I ""mentally"", would have been more ready for this last section."
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,It was clear that it was very useful for my future work,It got a little too rushed which was a shame. The course could benefit from a third day
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,"clear, straight to the point","don't do it at last afternoon, we had to go over it quite fast :("
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,It was very interesting material,"It was only a shame that there was not enough time to over it all, I think the content was very nice, especially the debugging."
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,Everything :),"The same goes here, more reading or watching materials before the course"
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,"I like how you create a clean version of the dataset that you start with after. Overall, the layout of how we should be organizing ourselves was the most helpful to mee.","No comments, I would just say more time maybe for the remaining part we did not finish. I would also like to see creation of functions to use for linear regression models."
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,Great introduction and exercises,N/A
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,All good,Nothing
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,Also good skilles to have.,This was a bit too complecated for me. But might have been suitable for others.
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,as above..(?),as above
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,?,More time
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,everything,nothing
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,Important subject about pivoting.,"Maybe a bit too many details on the pivoting functions and too little practical exercise. In my experience pivoting can cause a loot of problems, that you usually do not think about until they occur."
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,Very useful concepts explained nicely with examples,Nothing that I can think of now
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,We did not have much time but it was nice that Luke went through everything quickly,If the course was prolonged with another day then maybe we would have more energy to follow along and complete all the steps.
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,Worked very well overall.,Dont know.
Day 2,Workflow to analyzing your tidy data,Coding along worked very well.,"It think this session was very important but it was difficult for me to focus after the first session of the day. May be with additional exercises, this session can be performed on an extra day for the intermediate course."
