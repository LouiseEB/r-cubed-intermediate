Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Good explaining of the coding proces. Nice with the exercises,Maybe a little less group talk.
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",The instructions on the website and the coding along,Perhaps take this one slowly as many people were lagging behind and new things were coming up that needed trouble shooting
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Code along,Maybe less reading time
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Everything ran very smooth throughout the day,"I think sometimes it's quite stressful (applies to all sessions) when we are told to read something in e.g. ""10 minutes"", it actually makes me have to read things over again and taking longer because I feel stressed to read it in time and thus miss things"
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","Good with small data sets, so you could see what happened",It was a bit slow session. In my opinion we could have speeded ud.
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Easy to follow. Taking plenty of time to help everyone get through the exercises,"Sometimes I would have liked that you explained what the different functions did. Also, an explanation in the beginning of what the pre-course set up did."
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Very impressed over the structure. Help was fast. Everyone was prepared because f the pre-work. Well done.,No improvements needed
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","Good mix between reading exercises, code-along, individual coding time (with nice good opportunity for trouble-shooting with team-mates or supervisor).","Sometimes a bit of confusion, but as you say it's bound to happen, and it was always possible to catch up. Maybe would help if the line between ""help-time"" and ""speaker time"" was more clear, so that the speaker doesn't have to speak over the supervisors."
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","good speed, easy-to-follow and easy-to-understand session",sometimes too lengthy time for own excercise
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",step vise introduction,more clear presentation of the goal
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",It was good to learn about how vroom works and how to use it in our data,"The diagram explaining the workflow looks a bit confusing. I would try and simplify it a little bit, maybe by just showing each part independently for each session"

Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","teaching, and backup for help",a bit slow in pace while running codes
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",The typing of commands and getting results. Super nice tutors and lots of help.,the sticky notes - they keep falling of - but I have no better idea how to indicate that one is done.
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","the coding alongside the instructor and the use of ""stickies""","Personally, 4 examples is plenty. Progression to next exercise is a bit too slow for me"

Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",code along was nice. It was helpful to understand the steps involved to import data.files.,I think the content could have been covered in less time.
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","Code along, step-by-step approach",Define in the beginning why the column types are important to define
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Code-alongeasy access to helpstickiesdiscussionsGreat to switch methods/ways to learn,Shorter lunch break - perhaps 45 min?perhaps a word or two about git for those who is not familiar with the website (even though I know that was part of the pre-course preparation)
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",hands on,more contents and a bit faster
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","The format of reading, listening, discussing and coding. The learning manifested well.",Discussing what we would like out of importing data would be nice to initiate the workshop.
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",The code-along is a great setup when I run into problems. The code chunks seem fairly intuitive when you begin to learn to use them :),Nothing runs necessarily fast. I ran into a lot of problems with my own computer setup
Day 1,"Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",stickers ! that we did code-alongs togetherthat it was easy to get help from instructors,"a little more detail about what the different elements of the code reference to/means (fx -1 in ""col_select = -1"" means we delete column 1, details like that)"
Day 1,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",marking functions to save time,nothing

Day 1,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",connection of the course setup,a bit slow in pace while running codes
Day 1,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",nice explanation and very good to follow.,still not totally sure how to apply this for my data but I guess that will just come along with practicing and during the days.

Day 1,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",everything,"A bit more description on why we are doing the specific things. However, to many details are also time consuming"
Day 1,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",hands on,more contents and a bit faster
Day 1,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","The format of reading, listening, discussing and coding. The structure of getting the idea of developing an function are very well structured.","I think there could be more reflections on why we are taking the specific choice, when developing the functions."
Day 1,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",The session was presented well and in a nice tempo. The functions might make greater sense when I start to use them on my own data,"It would be so nice to use your own data. Sometimes it gets to flurry, even though we are asked to relate the theory to our own practice"
Day 1,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",seemed like a very useful tool ! easy to follow and get the code to work,"I was a little confused about how the different ""Description"", ""functions.R"" and ""lesson.rmd"" work together and how to get this setup when trying it out on my own"
Day 2,Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Nice pace of the class, not too slow and not too fast :)","I am not sure, I think it was a super good session"
Day 2,Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Great exercises. Very usable functions,Don't know. Maybe as above
Day 2,Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Same as above,Same as above
Day 2,Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Same as before, applies to all sessions, but really good combination of reading, having it explained, coding together and then on your own, slowly but effectively builds understanding and confidence in what you do. Also nice with many repetitions of the things from yesterday, e.g. making functions - difficult (for beginners at least) tasks that are really nice to repeat in different variations.",I think you're already doing great!
Day 2,Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,again it worked well with the switch between presentation and coding,a little break needed

Day 2,Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,reading and practice,no comments
Day 2,Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,The figures from the website explaining joining (and the functionals) were very helpfull,the rules of the regex was really hard to grasp
Day 2,Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Particularly enjoyed lerning about reduce and cause_when. I have bene using ifelse until now and when using many conditions, it gets confuisng and error prone. Really useful stuff.",It's not the course's fault but I found the regex part confusing. It is a difficult topic to understand  and I think it could be given more time for a better explanation.
Day 2,Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,brainstorming exercise was nice and new codes e.g. case_when comapred to if else,not sure
Day 2,Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,It very well.,"The tempo went suddenly a bit up, which made it difficult to follow in why we were doing the small changes in steps. But I think overall it was very well structured."
Day 2,Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"until 9.5 all worked well, speed was good","after 9.5 the session speed was too fast (or the day was too long, or the night was too short)"
Day 2,Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,good coding along.,too fast at the end and needed to slow down with maybe few explanations through the coding along
Day 2,Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,The reading material worked is very instructive,Short time to execute some tasks.
Day 2,Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,It's quite easy to follow the step by step instructions by the instructor.,"Exercise 9.3 made very little sense to me, as we hadn't really learned this yet and no one in the class figured it out. It became very hard very quick in the afternoon. I think there's too little repetition throughout the course. Learning requires repetition and I don't feel like there's much opportunity for this."
Day 2,Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Exercises,Brain stoming
Day 2,Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Nice illustrations + brainstorming. It is very helpful to point out differences/situatios when to use certain functions (e.g., if else vs. case_when)","Why duplication is the example is an issue, (day vs. sample column) was initially a bit unclear."
Day 2,Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"The infographic nicely described what the program does in terms of the different types of joining datasets (left, right and full)",It is difficult to see if everything has been joined in the right way. There does not seem to be a control function and you are unable to visually inspect the new joined dataset if you work with large datasets
Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","Nice pace of the class, not too slow and not too fast :)","I am not sure, I think it was a super good session"
Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Great exercises,Could perhaps speed things along although I appreciate that everyone needs to be able to follow the lessons
Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Good teaching and exercises.,A little more exercise and less group talk

Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",making function to import data sets,nothing
Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",They instructions were good,perhaps a summary at the end of the session will be good as it was spread over two days
Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Almost all,Less time for reading
Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",everything,Need to write more clear that you have to save your markdown file/scripts before restarting and checking the functionsStart earlier - 8 o'clock?
Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","It was useful to learn how to use the functionals to manipulate data frames (summarising statistics, renaming etc.)","Maybe a little more ""how to use this on your own data sets"""
Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",reading and practice,no comments
Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",exercises were more complicated than yesterday,"Asking us to read a section, and then repeating what was important from the section seemed a bit.... repetitive"
Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",It was a reall productive session. I have been using apply before but it has been cool to see the dplyr alternative and dig in on how it works,"No comments really, it was good"
Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",learning new functions,was very nice
Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","Everything, especially the intermediate step in building your data set","Maybe, force us more to put up questions."
Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",all worked well,"sometimes, the session could have speed up a little"
Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",all good. good explanation through the course,no
Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",The reading material worked is very instructive,It was difficult to remember the final part of the day before. Maybe a short review should help to move forward.
Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Functionals seem to be very useful. Instructions were clear.,Nothing in particular I can think of.
Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",revision of previous functions,Time increase
Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",The nice figures to illustrate the functions,No suggestions
Day 2,"Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Very applied and relevant. It can save you so much time in the future. I hope I can copy-paste it onto my own data,The roxygen skeleton needs further introduction and emphasis because it can seem redundant to write the code into this format when we are already documenting each step of the process by saving the code chunks
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,It was easy to follow instructions,I don't know
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,All good. Coding along.,All good
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,The material used and the explanations afterwards,Sometimes the speed of coding demonstration was high and difficult to follow.
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,work along was good.,could do pivots for repeated measurements? That would maybe give more context?
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Good with both reading and explaining for understanding the concept.,"No ideas for improvement, yet another really good session."
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Exercising the data,"If some more time can be assigned for this section, it may provide more time for the participants to complete their tasks and understand not only copying the instructor's code."
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Very useful code,No suggestions
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,I enjoyed the step-by-step approach to understand how you can re-arrange non-comprehensible data.,"Maybe there should be more ""links"" to the end product. Like ""we do this to, for instance, end up with a table 1, where we want to show..."". It is much easier grasping what to re-arrange when you have an (visual) idea of the end product."
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Great with slowly progressing on building a pivot table and in the end as a function,More examples and practice
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,summaries data using pivot,nothing
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,The illustrations in the reading material are good for understanding.,"Be a bit more specific in the introduction on, where it is especially useful."
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,guidance - teaching and practice,No comments
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"It was a great session, I have used gather and spread in the past and it is true that they are more confusing. Special mention to the figures, they help a lot to understand what's the process of pivoting","It actually doesn't count as pivot, but for a while I had problems transposing my data with t(). I think that a brief mention on this could be helpful to many people."
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,The tasks and I liked a lot that the short cuts were repeated often - that helped a lot to remember them.,in general: briefly explaining the output would help to understand also better what the code does
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,graphics in reading material illustrated concepts well,The removal on NA´s - can you incidentially remove non complete data? A bit more on what to do with incomplete data
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,learning about pivot,more examples
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,It was good,Maybe using more functions on the dataset.
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"Really well explained go-through of code and applicability. A lot of ""AHA"" experienced, as this session nicely summed up what we've been working towards throughout the last couple of days.","Not really too much to add. Would love a little more explanation of how this could be applied to the mmash dataset, but i guess that applies for the ""free time"" this afternoon :-)"
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Pivots are powerful in data analysis and this was a great introduction.,"The overall session was good but if one really needs to comment, instructors could pay more attention to keep showing the code after running (an overall comment for the course in general)."
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,It was good to see some of the  problems that one ca encounter  during re-arranging data.,"Since this topic need a bit more time to grasp, I think it would be beneficial to  have the groups discuss the code building among themselves. Like discussing , parts of the code for pivoting such as this is the function, this si argument etc."
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"Figures in syllabus, step from ""simple"" codes to functoins",Explain why functions are also helpfull if you use them once
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"it worked well, but I have used pivot_longer and pivot_wider before",it was all good
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Overall the course structure and graphical illustration of the workflow we worked through were helpful.,I felt the pivot functions would require more explanations. Why we specifically need to use them wasn't clear to me.
Day 3,Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"The way it was explained how pivots works, made it easier to grasp the concept","I think you stated something along the lines that ""doing long pivot would be advantageous"". That a long df was better than a wide. I still don't see why."
