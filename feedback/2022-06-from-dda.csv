To what extent do you think the professional programme of the course was well composed?,"I believe there was fine balnce between hands-on exercises, code-along-sessions and introductions/lectures"
To what extent do you think the professional programme of the course was well composed?,structured and well organised
To what extent do you think the professional programme of the course was well composed?,Good teachers and nice small group. Good mix of exercises and teaching 
To what extent do you think the professional programme of the course was well composed?,functional programming - very interesting 
To what extent do you think the professional programme of the course was well composed?,It seemed like there was a lot of thought put into the programme and how the materials were taught
To what extent do you think the professional programme of the course was well composed?,"Such a well prepared, well structured and informative course "
To what extent did you gain new knowledge of research in the area?,I think the course followed the course syllabus very nicely 
To what extent did you gain new knowledge of research in the area?,"I came knowing very little, now know a lot about how to structure and write code to create reproducible research"
To what extent were the lectures and code-alongs balanced throughout the course?,The code-along-sessions are very pedagogical and necessary to understand the coding language and learn the R programme. Sometimes I would have liked a more explicit explanation for each coding or documentation step
To what extent were the lectures and code-alongs balanced throughout the course?,Reading a section and the having it lectured felt redundant
To what extent were the lectures and code-alongs balanced throughout the course?,Coding along and exercises through the course
To what extent were the lectures and code-alongs balanced throughout the course?,Only thing was that afternoons were a bit too long
To what extent were the lectures and code-alongs balanced throughout the course?,excercices matched the level of the course well 
To what extent were the lectures and code-alongs balanced throughout the course?,"Good with frequent switch between lecture, reading tasks, brainstorming/group-work, code-along and independent coding."
To what extent did you expand your network with fellow students and researchers during the course?,"I didn't expect networking, met lots of nice people, though all seemed pretty tired after long days of lessons."
To what extent did the course create a good framework for meeting fellow students and researchers?,Perhaps changing seats every day would further networking 
To what extent did the course create a good framework for meeting fellow students and researchers?,"Good with group work, lunches together and frequent breaks for a bit of chitchat."
To what extent are you satisfied with the overall organisation of the course?,"This is a very well-planned course for the scientists who would need to do data analysis. The course has been great for those who want to use R and Luke ́s effort in combining R programming with reproducible research, in my opinion, has a great impact on young researchers ́ understanding and working with reproducible scientific data. In addition to this, the topics and exercises covered in this course can be applied to many different research topics. The course made me think of new ways to apply these in my current research. Unfortunately, teaching at such a high quality sometimes is not clearly visible and does not get the appreciation it deserves in academia, but I can only imagine how much work is to prepare the lectures and exercises for this course. And, how much more work went into perfecting the material. That is why, here I wanted to thank Luke and the team once again for this great course, and to DDA for supporting Luke in his ambition of making the scientific research environment a better place (...a class of young researchers at a time :))."
To what extent are you satisfied with the overall organisation of the course?,Very profesionally done.
