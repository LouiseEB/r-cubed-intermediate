Programme well composed?,"Loved learning to write reproducible functions. Nothing redundant, but could easily have benefited from more time"
Programme well composed?,"Very great and useful content! Unfortunately there was too much good content, as we didn't have time to cover."
Programme well composed?,"Very nice with a very detailed description on the course website, so you can go back and have a look"
Programme well composed?,All topics were very relevant to me. I learned a lot.
Programme well composed?,It was nice to get an insight in how to to organize and take your R-codes to a higher level
Programme well composed?,Final part got a little rushed but material was great
Programme well composed?,"I liked the theme of reproducibility and I liked that the programme was somewhat participant-directed at times (e.g., Luke asking how we'd like to approach sessions, particularly when time was limited)"
Gain new knowledge?,I learned a lot but I think I need time to reflect on what I have learned and how I can use it
Gain new knowledge?,It was incredibly useful
Gain new knowledge?,Absoutely! Just hoping I can keep it in mind and apply it to my own datasets
Lectures and code-alongs balanced?,"I felt that some of the code-along sessions ended up being somewhat long due to people having issues. I completely understand that it is important that everybody is following along, but perhaps there could have been hints, or code-snippets you could look at or access aftera certain amount of time. Alternatively, one could try to have challenges during the task forexample that isn't part of the curriculum, but which people are able to attempt while waiting."
Lectures and code-alongs balanced?,Inspired to change the way of working with data. Sometimes difficult to follow what was going on in the code along
Lectures and code-alongs balanced?,Code along and exercises were both great methods to learn.
Lectures and code-alongs balanced?,"The course was very intensive, you needed to code fast and the days were very long. Maybe it would be better to spend three days instead of two in order to do the coding-along and exercises more slowly - then its probably easier to reflect during learning."
Lectures and code-alongs balanced?,The course material made the exercises feel natural and logical
Good framework for meeting others?,it was a good idea with assigned seats on the first day
Good framework for meeting others?,It was nice because students could get gelp from each other and discuss. Also good opportunity to network at the dinner.
Satisfied with communications prior to course?,Course material only ready the day before the course
Satisfied with communications prior to course?,"The classrooms were very small considering the covid situation, and it did not seem like any precautions were made. It left me with a feeling that I should not have went to the course."
Satisfied with communications prior to course?,Material was very well prepared and clear.
Satisfied with communications prior to course?,"Everything prior the course was very professional however, the class rooms were way too small and we were not able to keep a distance of even 1 meter. In the light of corona this was really not okay."
Satisfied with communications prior to course?,Some confusion about whether there was a hotel from the 7th but that's the only nitpick I have
Satisfied with overall organization?,Great course leader
Satisfied with overall organization?,The organisation of the course itself was great. But in light of the new COVID restrictions I felt very uncomfortable with the setting of the course. We were too many people in the classrooms. The last day we were 23-24 in a room meant for 20 and the first day we were not able to keep the distance as recommended by the government and our organizations either. This did have an impact on the learning outcome as I did feel very uncomfortable in the classroom. And the teachers are very close to us all not keeping not keeping the recommeded distance when they look at our codes when they help us.
Satisfied with overall organization?,"Luke and his team were very motivated and motivating, extremely helpful."
How to improve for future?,"Have the course at the hotel, since I think most participants were from out of town anyway. Also hold the course over 3 days (3 short days is much better than 2 long days, since it is hard to focus on coding for 8 hours in a row) since there was not time to cover all material. Also, the classrooms at AaU were not ideal (not enough plugs, eating on top of the laptops) for a computer course."
How to improve for future?,"I really hope that DDA will ensure better safety related to Covid-19 in the future courses as we are many researchers meeting up from all over the country, and that DDA will ensure appropriate classrooms where we can feel safe to attend the course without fearing of getting infected, and where we can be able to keep the distance as required. If this is not possible the courses should be held online, although it does not give the same output, so I would like to attend future courses face-to-face but it needs to be in more safe circumstances than this course."
How to improve for future?,"This is a minor thing but, second day was so intense, extending the course with an extra day would be beneficial (3 days). I appreciate for the organisation and the quality of the course material. Thanks to the DDA and organisation commity."
How to improve for future?,"Absolutely great! :) The only few bad things are 1) the room the first day had a bit bad acoustics, as it was a bit difficult to hear what was being taught while people got help. The room the second day was better. 2) A shame we didn't have time to cover the last content."
How to improve for future?,"All the content in the course were highly relevant and presented in a meaningful way. However, the course was so intens, and I think it could improve the course, if it was divided into e.g. four days but with the same content. That would give the participants more time to work with the different elements."
How to improve for future?,Make more of these courses!
How to improve for future?,Shorter course days
How to improve for future?,An advanced course would be fantastic.
How to improve for future?,"Bigger class rooms, maybe prolong the course with one day."
How to improve for future?,Make it a three-day course so it is less rushed on day 2
How to improve for future?,Having it in larger rooms - the rooms were a bit small (and loud).
How to improve for future?,"Maybe encourage people to bring their own dataset? So that, if time permits, they can apply things during the course"
