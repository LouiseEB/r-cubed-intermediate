Thank you so much! I hope √ç can re-take this course in the future.
No other feedback. Thank you for the course!
"I think it is a great course and an very important topic. All the content is very relevant, but I think that there might be some elements in the structure of the course that could be changed, which could improve how much we benefit from the course (or at least how much I learned from the course). I would recommend that you consider whether you could give us more time between the sections. ex. spread the course over four days (e.g. only four half days), and then give some time - e.g. a week between the sections, so that we have the chance to work on the material at home. The knowledge from the course is so important but Im a bit afraid that I will only use a smaller part of it, as I get a bit overloaded."
This is an impressive amount of work and I am really grateful you took the time to make this possible. Thank you!
"I think it was super great! I know you learn a lot from the code along, but perhaps it can go a liiiiiittle faster, so we can get to learn all the cool stuff you have prepared. I know this is problematic, because some people do struggle with their computers and help and so on."
"No, have a great time and thanks :)"
Thanks for a great course and incredible good instructors all of you. Thanks for your patience
"Really enjoyed this course, could already think of many opportunities to use the learned content."
"I should probably have taken the introduction course first. The level was a bit to high for me to really learn. Sometimes, I did not know exactly what we were doing. For me, the days were a bit long to keep concentrated, especially since I found the level to be a bit too high for me."
the days were too long/too packed - would have prefered to work more with the things on our own (instead of code along) and then going through things in plenum. I sort of miss how to actually share to code. We commited in git but didn't do anything with it afterwards - so I'm still not sure how to actually share my code.
I would benefit from being able to read through the course material before the course. There were several times where I lost track of where we were going with something - ending in total confusion.
"In generel I think it is amazing that everything is on the homepage, so I can go back and find what we learned. One thing that maybe could be improved would be if we could incorporate our own data in the course. Talk about how we could make our own data better, what functions we could do in order to code better and so on."
"Very good job! It was a pleasure to participate, wish it lasted longer. Will come back for the full semester course. Or masters degree?"
Thank you!!!
