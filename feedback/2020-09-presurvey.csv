PhD student,Aalborg,Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and extracellular vesicles,Intermediate,Intermediate,Beginner-Intermediate,Beginner-Intermediate,Beginner-Intermediate,Beginner-Intermediate,SPSS,"As I am very much self-taught when it comes to R and programming I often have the mentality that as long at the syntax do what I wish of it, it must be perfect. This is especially true for data-wrangling, where I somehow always end up with very messy raw-data.  I hope that this course might instil upon me a more official and simpler way to go about data-analysis (especially wrangling) using R. And also give me some pointers and critique  my not-optimal way of writing syntax.",My expectations matches somewhat.,It match with me somewhat.,Yes,I had most of it up and running already. But it seemed like a good way to get people up to date with stuff.,"I would personally prefer installing the packages and running commands manually using something similar of a R-script file compared to a companion package (R3). This is as I prefer to know what exactly I am doing. Additionally, we ran some functions from the usethis package, without an explanation off the function. I would have appreciated a short description of the functions before having to run them."

Fair to refer to the material for the introduction course.,"I was unsure whether my output from r3::check_project_setup() looks as it is supposed to.This was my first time installing Git and first there was no Git icon in RStudio, which confused me a lot. It appeared when I created my first project. A comment about this would have been helpful :-)"

However, Github and Git I haven't worked much with since the intro course.",Yes,"Think its a really good idea with the check functions, to see if our current versions, installations etc. actually worked correctly. Works fine with linking back to the intro course description. Its a good way to go back and look at stuff we have already worked with to remind yourself on how the things worked.","Think it all worked fine, one small think that I couldn't get to work when I went back and practiced a few things from the the intro course was: when I go back to read the Version control with Git I couldn't find the page you have on your screenshot for figure 8.8 in my Github account - especially I was curious on finding the ...or push an existing repository from the command line code to put into the R-studio terminal. I assume that when we have created a new R project (LearnR3) this can later be linked with Github with use of that code from Github - I just couldn't seem to find it. But I guess we might do this together in the intermediate course."

I had issues with updating the package xfun. I needed to delete it from both my programfiles and user R folder in order to finally install r3. Not sure if anything can be improved here, except maybe allow installation of parts of the r3 package and then be able to go back and sort out the rest later. As it is, the installation is terminated until ALL packages can be correctly installed/updated.Also, I couldn’t make this line of code work: prodigenr::setup_project(~/Desktop/LearnR3)It *does* create the project, but not all the subfolders, which causes problems in the next step. I ended up deleting the folder on the desktop and creating the project manually."
