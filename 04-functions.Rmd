# Creating your own function {#functions}

<!-- Day 2 morning (8:30, lunch at 12:00 --- ~3.5 hrs, with one big break, one small one during exercise): -->

- creating functions
    - and when using tidyverse functions
- package dependency
    - use_package
    - ::
- Moving functions into own R file
    - Then either sourcing or load_all (maybe not get into that for them)
- debugging in functions
    - breaks in RStudio?
    - basics like print.

- Use a custom function in the advanced dplyr, to link to previous?
