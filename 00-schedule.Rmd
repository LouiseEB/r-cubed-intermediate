# Schedule {#schedule}

The workshop is structured as a series of participatory live-coding sessions
(instructor and learner coding together) interspersed with hands-on exercises
and group work, using a real-world dataset or applying the skills learned to
your own datasets. There are some lectures given, mainly at the start and end of
the workshop. The general schedule outline is shown in the below table.

```{r schedule-table, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
options(knitr.kable.NA = "")
schedule <- readr::read_csv(
    here::here("resources/schedule.csv"),
    col_types = cols(`Date and time` = col_character(),
                     `Session topic` = col_character())
)
knitr::kable(schedule, align = "l", caption = "Overall course schedule for the 3 days.")
```
