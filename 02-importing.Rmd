`r '<!-- '`

- fs
    - introduce this package to get ready for later use?
- vroom

Day 1 morning: (10:00, lunch at 12:30 --- ~2.5 hrs)

description of vroom

- download datasets to use as practice?
    - https://physionet.org/content/mmash/1.0.0/
        - https://physionet.org/static/published-projects/mmash/multilevel-monitoring-of-activity-and-sleep-in-healthy-people-1.0.0.zip
        - DOI https://doi.org/10.13026/cerq-fc86
- use_data_raw()
- use_data(), combined with load()

- importing lots of data files

- Keeping raw data raw.
- vroom
    - why vroom? Super fast, can use multi-processing (parallel processing),
    uses a thing called "alternative representation" (altrep) that allows data
    (especially character string data) to be loaded in without taking up much 
    memory because it doesn't directly load the data in but rather link it to
    some internal "letter blocks" (don't need to go into this much)
- csv and talk about tab-delim
- col_*, including col_skip() (or the character version like "i", "f", "-", "D")
- using specs to make it easier to load data and set data types (esp if large data)
    - Start small, import only bit of dataset before loading all of it.
    
## Code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(here)
usethis::use_data_raw("mmash", open = FALSE)
# Open up and use the mmash R script.
# TODO: Use r3 for link? r3::mmash_zip_link
mmash_link <- "https://physionet.org/static/published-projects/mmash/multilevel-monitoring-of-activity-and-sleep-in-healthy-people-1.0.0.zip"
download.file(mmash_link, destfile = here("data-raw/mmash-data.zip"))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(here)
# This could be executed on gitlab-ci?
unzip(here("data-raw/mmash-data.zip"), 
      exdir = here("data-raw"),
      # This unzipped into the data-raw folder
      junkpaths = TRUE)
unzip(here("data-raw/MMASH.zip"),
      exdir = here("data-raw"))

library(vroom)
user_1 <- vroom(here("data-raw/DataPaper/user_1/user_info.csv"))
spec(user_1)
# Search help documentation to show what to do next (e.g. use col_types)
user_1_fix <- vroom(
    here("data-raw/DataPaper/user_1/user_info.csv"),
    col_types = cols(
        Gender = col_character(),
        Weight = col_double(),
        Height = col_double(),
        Age = col_double()
    )
)

# Error, look at file and see missing first column.
# Search help documentation to show what to do next (e.g. use col_select -1)
user_1_fix <- vroom(
    here("data-raw/DataPaper/user_1/user_info.csv"),
    col_select = -1,
    col_types = cols(
        Gender = col_character(),
        Weight = col_double(),
        Height = col_double(),
        Age = col_double()
    )
)
```

Sometimes you have a dataset that's just a bit too large and sometimes
vroom may not have enough information to guess the column data type
or you don't want to read in all the dataset, but only specific columns
In that case, we can do a trick: read in only first few lines of the dataset,
use spec, fix the col_type

- then fix column names based on data dictionary

```{r}
user_1_fix <- vroom(
    here("data-raw/DataPaper/user_1/RR.csv"),
    col_select = -1,
    col_types = cols(
        Gender = col_character(),
        Weight = col_double(),
        Height = col_double(),
        Age = col_double()
    )
)
```

## Exercises

using help doc and data dictionary, find how to rename columns to be more 
descriptive of the contents of the file.

```{r}
user_1_saliva <- vroom(
    here("data-raw/DataPaper/user_1/saliva.csv"),
    col_select = -1)
spec(user_1_saliva)

user_1_rr_fix <- vroom(
    here("data-raw/DataPaper/user_1/saliva.csv"),
    col_select = -1,
    col_type = cols(
        ibi_s = col_double(),
        day = col_double(),
        time = col_time(format = "")
    )
)
# Search help documentation to show how to find this stuff.

user_1_rr_fix <- vroom(
    here("data-raw/DataPaper/user_1/RR.csv"),
    col_select = -1,
    col_type = cols(
        ibi_s = col_double(),
        day = col_double(),
        time = col_time(format = "%H:%M:%S")
    )
)
```

Use technique to read in actigraph and select specific cols
and set col_types
- keep only 
- Look through data dictionary and rename columns to be more descriptive

```{r}

```

`r '-->'`
