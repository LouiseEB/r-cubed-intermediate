- Commit everything
- Delete all code in lesson.Rmd related to importing or cleaning the data
- Commit changes
- Knit document to make sure it generates html file.
    - going to be doing this quite a bit throughout, so need to make sure
    it works right now.

- split-apply-combine
- group_by -> summarize function?
    - mean, sd, max, min for age, weight, cortisol.
- Exercise: Try out on other variables
- but the above quickly becomes unreadable.
- Move to longer for since the eye has an easier time scanning down then
it does across in table formats
- pivot longer
- This is nice, but we now have multiple distinct items in same column
(mean and sd), in both values and names
    - deeper into tidyselect helpers
- separate (tidyr)
- pivot_wider

- Convert to function. As exercise?
    - It won't work... but that's ok.
- debugging in functions
    - browser function
- creating functions
    - and when using tidyverse functions 
    - NSE

    
- Discussion: How to make it so we can also add any type of summary
statistic?
    - think for a minute about this: How to get so we can also give our
    own custom summary statistics, like use min instead.

- debugging in functions
    - browser in RStudio?
    - Inside talk through ways to look over code and figure things
    out in there.
        - e.g. list(mean = mean) is named... so we could use that in
        ends_with
            - use names(list(mean = mean)) to show it.
            - use 

- Exercise: Convert function to let you 
    - This might be challenging, ask neighbour for ideas

- Use function to output knitr table
    - knit and check out how it looks
    - It's recommended to knit to Word only when absolutely necessary
    (e.g. emailing to co-authors for comments),
    since Word locks the file when its open, so knitting requires a 
    "close Word first" process, which gets annoying quickly.

- Exercise: Add to function to round value of summary stat
    - include as argument to set digit rounding?

- pipe results into mutate to make table even prettier
    - e.g. with glue::glue(mean (sd))
    
- filter to look into problem rows

- Exercise: Rename columns to be more descriptive, remove extra columns
    - Go back and update mmash.R file, restart R, source.
    
- Exercise: get them to do everything and create a second final dataset
with only the full actigraph and RR data, joined by user, day, and time.

## Final exercise: Process and join sleep and questionnaire data

Time: 30 min

You now have all the skills and tools needed to do everything we've
done to import, process, and join datasets. Its time to test these
skills and tool by applying them to the `sleep.csv` and
`questionnaire.csv` datasets. So to these workflows to get these
datasets into the final, merged form:

- Import with the `vroom()`, `spec()`, `vroom()` workflow.
- Convert into a function with the `doc/lesson.Rmd` to `R/function.R`,
restart R, and `load_all()` workflow.
- Test that the datasets join properly while in `doc/lesson.Rmd`
then cut and paste into `data-raw/mmash.R` workflow.
- Restart R and re-create the `data/mmash.rda` dataset by
sourcing `data-raw/mmash.R` workflow.
- Restart R, load the new dataset with `load_all()`
(`Ctrl-Shift-L`), and analyze it in `doc/lesson.Rmd` workflow.
- Add any additional cleaning code to `data-raw/mmash.R` and
update the `data/mmash.rda` dataset whenever you find problems
workflow.
- Write R in code chunks in the `doc/lesson.Rmd` to further
analyze your data and check reproducibility by often knitting to
HTML workflow.
    - Part of this workflow is to also write R code to output
    in a way that looks nice in the HTML (or Word) output
    by mostly e.g. creating tables or figures of the output.

And **don't forget**, for each stage, add and commit the changes
you've made to the files into the Git history.

Other ideas:

- Run multiple models and extract only some information?
- Run models on re-sampled sets?

## Code:

```{r}
test_function <- function(mmash_df, cols) {
    mmash_df %>%
        group_by(day) %>%
        summarise(across(cols,
                         list(mean = mean, sd = sd),
                         na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
        pivot_longer(c(contains(c("_mean", "_sd")))) %>%
        separate(name,
                 into = c("variable", "summary_statistic"),
                 sep = "_") %>%
        mutate(value = round(value, 1)) %>%
        pivot_wider(names_from = summary_statistic, values_from = value) 
}

test_function(mmash, c(age))


mmash %>% 
    group_by(day) %>% 
    summarise(across(
        c(age, weight),
        list(mean = mean, sd = sd), 
        na.rm = TRUE
    )) %>% 
    pivot_longer(c(contains(c("_mean", "_sd")))) %>% 
    separate(name, into = c("variable", "summary_statistic"), sep = "_") %>% 
    mutate(value = round(value, 1)) %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = summary_statistic, values_from = value) 
```
## Exercise: Update the `mmash.R` script with fixes you found from EDA

## Misc

What happened? We had an error. We've encountered a problem due to
"[non-standard evaluation]" (or NSE). NSE is very commonly used in most tidyverse
packages as well as throughout base R. It's one of the first things computer 
scientists complain about when they use R, because it is such a foreign thing
in other programming languages. But NSE is what allows you to use formulas (e.g.
`y ~ x + x2` in modelling) or allows you to type out `select(Gender, BMI)`. In
other programming languages, it would be `select("Gender", "BMI")`. It gives a lot
of flexibility to use for doing data analysis, but can give some headaches when
programming in R. So instead we have to use quotes instead and use the `_at()` 
combined with `vars()` version of dplyr functions. The tidyr functions `gather`
and `spread` don't require these changes.

## Converting between wide and long data

We've covered the basic "verbs" (functions) of the dplyr package.
Now we'll get into the "pivot" functions from dplyr's companion package, tidyr. 
There are many useful functions in the tidyr package, 
but the pivot functions (`pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`) are key ones.
Pivoting converts wide data into long data or vice versa.
So what is wide or long date?

Wide data is data where values may repeat across columns. 
With repeated measurements, it is often easier to enter data in wide form
or to use wide data to present in tables.
But there are problems with wide data, especially when it comes to analysing it. 
For instance, wide data may look like:

```{r table-example-wide, echo=FALSE}
example_wide <- tribble(
    ~PersonID, ~Glucose_0, ~Glucose_30, ~Glucose_60,
    1, 5.6, 7.8, 4.5,
    2, 4.7, 9.5, 5.3,
    3, 5.1, 10.2, 4.2
) 

example_wide %>% 
    knitr::kable(caption = "Example of a **wide** dataset that is useful for data entry.",
                 align = "c")
```

However, this type of data is not *tidy* for a few reasons:

1. We don't know precisely what the values represent in the glucose columns
(though in this case we could guess, but this isn't always the case).
Often in the wide form you need to rely a lot more on either very descriptive names
or have a detailed data dictionary to refer to.
1. The glucose columns all represent the same value type (glucose concentration) 
so there is some duplication *of meaning* between columns.
1. The column names include data in them as well (time of glucose measurement). 

On the other hand, a long data form is usually better suited for almost any type of analysis
and for visualizing, especially when doing [split-apply-combine] techniques. 
Long form data also tends to be more *tidy* compared to wide form.

```{r table-example-long, echo=FALSE}
example_wide %>% 
    pivot_longer(-PersonID, names_to = "MeasurementTime", values_to = "GlucoseConcentration", 
                 names_prefix = "Glucose_") %>% 
    mutate(MeasurementTime = as.numeric(MeasurementTime)) %>% 
    knitr::kable(caption = "Example of a **long** dataset that is more usable for analyses and visualizing.",
                 align = "c")
```

### Pivot from wide to long

How, when, and why to pivot your data can be conceptually challenging to grasp at first. 
Let's try out some examples and use `pivot_longer()`. 
Like all the other functions, the first position argument to `pivot_longer()` is the data.
The other necessary arguments (in order) are:

1. `cols`: The columns to use to convert to long form. 
The input is a vector made using `c()` that contains the column names,
like you would use in `select()` (e.g. you can use the `select_helpers` like `starts_with()`,
or `-` minus to exclude).
1. `names_to`: The name of the newly created column (as a quoted character) 
that contains the original column names.
1. `values_to`: The name of the newly created column (as a quoted character)
that contains the original cells of the original columns.

As with everything, using an example would help clarify things.
In the NHANES dataset, there are several columns that would be suitable for pivoting,
because they are "messy". These are the `BP` blood pressure columns.
Let's select the required `ID` and `SurveyYr` and the `BP` columns
(we'll exclude the `Ave` ones for now), then we'll use `pivot_longer()`.
Because we only want to pivot the `BP`, we need to exclude `ID` and `SurveyYr`
from pivoting by using `-`.

```{r}
NHANES %>%
    # Recall that - (minus) is used to exclude
    select(ID, SurveyYr, starts_with("BP"), -ends_with("Ave")) %>% 
    pivot_longer(c(-ID, -SurveyYr), names_to = "BPTypeAndNumber", values_to = "BloodPressure")
```

We use `-` here to tell `pivot_longer()` to *not* include 
(to *exclude*) the columns from being converted to long form.
We could even use `starts_with()`:

```{r}
NHANES %>%
    # Recall that - (minus) is used to exclude
    select(ID, SurveyYr, starts_with("BP"), -ends_with("Ave")) %>% 
    pivot_longer(starts_with("BP"), names_to = "BPTypeAndNumber", values_to = "BloodPressure")
```

The reason that the arguments `names_to` 
and `values_to` require quoting `""` is that these are the column names that we *will* create.
Because they don't exist yet as columns, we need to use the quotes.

### Pivot from long to wide

You can also convert from long to wide, though this is less commonly done,
as most analyses either work better or require the long form. 
It can also be much more tricky to convert over to.
But sometimes you may need to have a wide form for your data.
Here you can use `pivot_wider()` function. Others have used `pivot_wider()` for creating summary tables for presentation or to capture data in a format needed by other tools. Like its opposite,
the first position argument is the data and the other necessary arguments are:

1. `id_cols`: This is optional as it will default to all column names. 
This argument tells `pivot_wider()` to use the given columns as the identifiers
for when converting. 
This is where the tricky part comes in, 
because 
1. `names_from`: Similar to the `pivot_longer()`, 
this is the name of the column that will make up the new columns.
Unlike in `pivot_longer()`, 
the column name given is *unquoted* since the column 
*must already exist* in the dataset.
1. `values_from`: As with above, this is the column name 
(that exists and must be given *unquoted*) 
for the values that will be in the new columns.

Unfortunately, 
NHANES as it is doesn't have a structure that allows us to easily convert to wide form.
So we'll use the `table2` example from the beginning of the wrangling section:

```{r}
table2
```

This data frame is in a very long format. 
So we could pivot `type` and `count` into the wide format:

```{r}
table2 %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = count)
```

If we wanted to make it even wider, 
we could include `year` and `type` in the pivoting by wrapping them with `c()`
in the `names_from` argument:

```{r}
table2 %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = c(year, type), values_from = count)
```

The key to using `pivot_wider()` is that there are uniquely identifying rows
that allow pivoting that maintains the integrity of the data.
Since the NHANES dataset we use is for teaching purposes,
there are some cases where the same person is recorded multiple times in one survey year,
which doesn't make sense and prevents us from adequately pivoting wider.

## Pivot, then split-apply-combine {#pivot-sac}

The real strength of pivoting is when you use it with the [split-apply-combine] method.
For instance, if we wanted to find some simple statistics of all the columns
by survey year and sex. 
In this case, we would use `pivot_longer()` to convert to a long form
and then use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to find the simple statistics.
So let's find the mean values of some continuous variables.

```{r}
nhanes_mean_values <- NHANES %>%
    rename(Sex = Gender) %>%
    select(SurveyYr, Sex, BMI, Age, starts_with("BP")) %>%
    pivot_longer(c(-SurveyYr, -Sex),
                 names_to = "Variables",
                 values_to = "Values") %>%
    group_by(SurveyYr, Sex, Variables) %>% 
    summarize(MeanValues = mean(Values, na.rm = TRUE))
nhanes_mean_values
```

We could now use `pivot_wider()` since the structure allows for it:

```{r}
nhanes_mean_values %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = Variables, values_from = MeanValues)
```

Which now gives us the mean values of the variables by sex and survey year!
